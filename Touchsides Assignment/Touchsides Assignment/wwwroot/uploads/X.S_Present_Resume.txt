SUMMARY I am a software developer with a solid background in a wide range of .Net development aspects in a business application context.

In addition to my technical skills, I currently ventured on Automation Testing using Python, Behave Framework with Selenium to test frontend, and BDD for backend, etc. I am a great communicator and team player. My ability to communicate well enables me to work effectively with clients and development team to identify objectives and requirements for applications.
